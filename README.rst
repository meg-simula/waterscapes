Computational brainphatics: simulating the brain's waterscape
=============================================================

The waterscapes repository contains a collection of simulation
software for mathematical modelling and simulation of brain mechanics
including computational methods for simulating fluid flow and
transport in and around the brain. The solvers are based on the finite
element method and the FEniCS Project finite element software
(http://www.fenicsproject.org)

Documentation
=============

This collection is structured by

  data/     Raw data and processing utilies, mainly brain geometry-oriented
  meshes/   Finite element meshes and associated information (markers)
  src/      Solver collection
  sandbox/  Playground for experimental features, testing etc.

Further documentation is available for each module/package/library
contained within the waterscapes solver collection.
