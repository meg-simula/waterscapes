  surface output
- merged cerebellum, brain stem and brain ventricles from MNI
  segmented volume to voxelated FreeSurfer surfaces
- recreated CSF surface, and the CSF layer is more accurate in 
  thickness
- optimized mesh using iso2mesh options distbound and radbound


= Version 1 - 07/25/2010 =

- initial release of Version 1 brain atlas mesh
